These are the best practices we have found, in a variety of areas.  Where possible, we link directly to the core operational documents of the system in question, rather than just sending you to their web site.  

Importantly, this document is intended to be built upon.  We have gone to significant effort to make it simple for you to clone and remix this document.  Please add the best practices you know of, and improve your copy of this list in any way you see fit.
